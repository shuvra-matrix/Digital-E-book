        <li>Arduino boards are able to read analog or digital input signals from different sensors and turn it into an output such as activating a motor, turning LED on/off, connect to the cloud and many other actions.</li>
        <li>We can control our board functions by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board via Arduino IDE (referred to as uploading software).</li>
        <li>Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, Arduino does not need an extra piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load a new code onto the board. We can simply use a USB cable.</li>
        <li>Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making it easier to learn to program.</li>
        <li>Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks the functions of the micro- controller into a more accessible package.</li>
